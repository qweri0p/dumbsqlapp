# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
bun create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
bun create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `bun install`, start a development server:

```bash
bun --bun run dev

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun run preview`.
